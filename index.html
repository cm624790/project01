<h3>MY EXPERIENCE</h3>

<div class="maintext">


<p>The most challenging part about this project was having a vision of what I wanted a page to look like but stuggling to find the specific attributes to carry out said visions, especially in regards to <a href="page1.html">Page 2</a>. I had a lot of trouble figuring out the hover text on the album art. There were definitely an abundance of tutorials for all different styles of hover text but many of them were either someone else's work, too difficult for me to understand, or messed with my already coded animations. I ended up just using the tooltip attribute and placing it at the top of my images. </p>

<p>Before this assingment, I had rarely used animations before. While trying to figure out the hover test that I had previously mentioned, I came across a lot of animations that I'd be interested in trying to recreate in the fututre.</p>

<p>I've always really enjoyed the more artistic aspects of web degins, choosing typeface, color scheme, etc., more than the more technical aspect. In my pervious web design class, I was rarely given the opportunity to have much artistic freedom (even though I usually keep things fairly simple) so being able to decide things for myself was my favorite part of this assignment.</p>

Were there any techniques you learned by doing this project?

Did you use any resources to help you with this project?

Did you find any tutorials that, although they didn’t seem to have anything to do with this project, you thought were kind of cool and you might want to check them out later?

Did you try anything out and have to delete it because it just wasn’t working?

How would you improve a portion of this project?
